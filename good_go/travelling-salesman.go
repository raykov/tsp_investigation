// Travelling Salesman Problem
//
// The travelling salesman problem (TSP) asks the following question:
// "Given a list of cities and the distances between each pair of
// cities, what is the shortest possible route that visits each
// city and returns to the origin city?"
//
// TSP can be modelled as an undirected weighted graph, such that
// cities are the graph's vertices, paths are the graph's edges,
// and a path's distance is the edge's weight. It is a minimization
// problem starting and finishing at a specified vertex after having
// visited each other vertex exactly once. Often, the model is a
// complete graph (i.e. each pair of vertices is connected by an
// edge). If no path exists between two cities, adding an arbitrarily
// long edge will complete the graph without affecting the optimal tour.
