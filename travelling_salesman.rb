# Travelling Salesman Problem
#
# The travelling salesman problem (TSP) asks the following question:
# "Given a list of cities and the distances between each pair of
# cities, what is the shortest possible route that visits each
# city and returns to the origin city?"
#
# TSP can be modelled as an undirected weighted graph, such that
# cities are the graph's vertices, paths are the graph's edges,
# and a path's distance is the edge's weight. It is a minimization
# problem starting and finishing at a specified vertex after having
# visited each other vertex exactly once. Often, the model is a
# complete graph (i.e. each pair of vertices is connected by an
# edge). If no path exists between two cities, adding an arbitrarily
# long edge will complete the graph without affecting the optimal tour.
